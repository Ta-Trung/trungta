# trungta - WordPress theme designed by Trung Ta using _s-template 
The theme is designed originally by HTML, CSS and SASS technique. In order to make change to this layout, firstly we need to install node_modules by this command ‘npm install node-sass’ and then calling the function ‘npm run compile:sass’ so that all the changes of css will be written to main.css in real time.
